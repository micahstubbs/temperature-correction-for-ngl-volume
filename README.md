Temperature Correction for the Volume of NGL and LPG - Table 24E

Using [this post](http://mooringmarineconsultancy.wordpress.com/2013/08/03/temperature-correction-factors-for-the-volume-of-lpg-ngl-part-1/) as a guide, this spreadsheet calculates the correction factors for a relative density (specific gravity) range of 0.45 to 0.68 and a temperature range of 0.0°F to 120.0°F.

Proper respect to [Ron Mooring](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ronmooring) for expressing these calculations in a clear, accessible form.
